# TPS REPORTS
# Using a Bash script, generate an email message that reminds the user to submit a TPS report by a certain day. Your script should accept a date or day
# as an input argument. For example, if the user inputs "Tuesday", then the output should look something like:

# "Please submit your TPS reports by EOD Tuesday. Your cooperation in this matter is much appreciated."

# For an extra challenge, have your script accept arguments for:
# * Name of recipient(s)
# * Due date for TPS reports
# * Motivational closing
# * Sender

# If any of the arguments are blank, the email should output a default word or phrase.
