# ALARM CLOCK
# Create a Bash script that "sleeps" for a given number of seconds before beeping after the time has elapsed. You can make this exercise more challenging by
# adding features to your alarm clock, such as:

# * An input argument that accepts time rather than the number of seconds.
# * A snooze function that lets you reset the alarm clock to go off again after a given number of minutes.
# * An option that enables you to choose from different beeping sounds in your computer system.
# * An option that plays an audio file stored on your computer.
