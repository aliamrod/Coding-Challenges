# AWK COMMANDS
# Another way to work with text in Bash is with AWK commands. For this challenge we will use the following dataset of the world's countries and their capitals.
# Link: https://github.com/aliamrod/Coding-Challenges/blob/main/Bash_Scripting/c5_supplementary.csv

# Create a Bash script that outputs this dataset into two columns: one for the country and the other for its capital.

# For an added challenge, have your script accept a letter as input. The output should be just the countries that start with the input letter.
# For another challenge, create another Bash script that outputs a two-column list sorted alphabetically by capital city.
