# DETECT MOUNTED DISKS
# Programmers who work in Bash are often System Administrators who manage computer and server networks. So, it's important to known which disks and file systems 
# are mounted -- that is, accessible by the computer's file system. Note that just because a disk or computer is physically attached with cables doesn't always mean
# that it's mounted and accessible.

# Come up with a Bash script that detects whether a given mount point or file system is mounted. If so, the script should return the amount of used space on the file system 
# and the amount of free space. If the file system isn't mounted, your script should return an error message.

# For an added challenge, add a prompt to your script that asks the user if they want to attempt to mount the file system if it's unmounted. 
# When the file system mounts, the script should then output the amount of used space and free space in the file system.
