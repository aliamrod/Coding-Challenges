# RECURSION COUNTDOWN
# Recursion is when a function calls itself to perform the same task until some condition is met. This is most commonly done in Bash with loops.

# Create a countdown generator in Bash that accepts a positive integer as input. The output should show numbers decreasing, starting with the input number until 0.
# After displaying 0, the output should also display "Blast off!". 

# Looking for something a little more challenging, try creating a Bash function that accepts any number of arguments. The output should print out
# each argument on a new line. Your Bash script should use the echo command only once.
