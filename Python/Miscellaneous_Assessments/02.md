Gifting Groups

At Audible, a subscriber can gift an audiobook from his/her library to any other non-subscriber to kickstart their audiobook journey. 
The first time subscriber can receive up to a maximum of N audiobooks from their friends/relatives. When a non-subscriber receives an audiobook, we can 
infer that the two may be related. Similarly, if the non-subscriber received gifted books from two other subscribers, we can 
infer that all of them are related and the three of them form a *group*. More formally, a *group* is composed of all of the people who known one another, 
whether directly or transitively. Audible would like your help finding out the number of such distinct groups from the input data.

Example:

Consider the following input matrix *_M_*:

110
110
001

Every row corresponds to a subscriber and the value *_M[i][j]_* determines if _*j*_ was gifted a book by *_i_*. In the above example, 
user 0 has gifted a book to user 1 and so they are connected [0][1], while person _2_ has not received a book from anyone or gifted book to anyone. Therefore, there
are _2_ groups. 

M[i][j] = 1 if i==j (Each of the people is known to self). 

Function Description:
Complete the function _countGroups_ in the editor 

countGroups has the following parameter(s):

_int related[n]_: an array of strings of binary digits _relatedn[i]_ that represent connections of people.
