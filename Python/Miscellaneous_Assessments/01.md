# Amazon Transaction Logs
Your Amazonian team is responsible for maintaining a monetary transaction service. The transactions are tracked in a log file.

A log file is provided as a string array where each entry represents a transaction to service. Each transaction consists of:

++ sender_user_id: Unique identifier for the user that initiated the transaction. It consists of only digits at most 9 digits. 

++ recipient_user_id: Unique identifier for the user that is receiving the transaction. It consists of only digits with at most 9 digits. 

++ amount_of_transaction: The amount of the transaction. It consists of only digits with at most 9 digits. 

The values are separated by a space. For example, "_sender_user_id_ _recipient_user_id_ _amount_of_transaction_".

Users that perform an excessive amount of transactions might be abusing the service so you have been tasked to identify the users that have a number of transacations over a threshold. The list of user ids should be ordered in ascending numeric value. 

**Example**
_logs_ = _["88 99 200", "88 99 300", "99 32 100", "12 12 15"]_
_threshold_ = _2_


The transactions count for each user, regardless of role are: 
| ID | Transactions |
| :---:   | :---: | 
| 99 | 3   |
| 88 | 2   |
| 12 | 1   |
| 32 | 1   |
