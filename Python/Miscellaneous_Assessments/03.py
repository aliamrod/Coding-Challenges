# Amazon Fresh is running a promotion in which customers receive prizes for purchasing a secret combination of fruits. The combination will change each day, 
# and the team running the promotion wants to use a code list to make it easy to change the combination. The code list contains groups of fruits. Both the
# order of the groups within the code list and the order of the fruits within the groups matter.

# However, between the groups of fruits, any number, and type of fruit is allowable. The term "anything" is used to allow for any type of fruit to appear in 
# that location within the group.

# Consider the following secret code list: [[apple, apple], [banana, anything, banana]]

# Based on the above secret code list, a customer who made either of the following purchases would win the prize:
# orange, apple, apple, banana, orange, banana
# apple, apple, orange, orange, banana, apple, banana, banana
# Write an algorithm to output 1 if the customer is a winner else output 0.

# Input
# The input to the function/method consists of two arguments:
# codeList, a list of lists of strings representing the order and grouping of specific fruits that must be purchased in order to win the prize for the day.
# shoppingCart, a list of strings representing the order in which a customer purchases fruit.
# Output
# Return an integer 1 if the customer is a winner else return 0.
# Note
# 'anything' in the codeList represents that any fruit can be ordered in place of 'anything' in the group. 'anything' has to be something, it cannot be "nothing."
# 'anything' must represent one and only one fruit.
# If secret code list is empty then it is assumed that the customer is a winner.
