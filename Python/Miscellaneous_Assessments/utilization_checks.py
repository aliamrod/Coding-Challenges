# A new Amazon-developed scaling computing system checks the average utilization of the computing system every second while it monitors.
# It implements an autoscale policy to add or reduce instances depending on the current load as described below. Once an action of adding or reducing
# the number of instances is performed, the system will stop monitoring for 10 seconds. During that time, the number of instances does not change.

# Average utilization < 25%: An action is instantiated to reduce the number of instances by half if the number of instances is greater than 1 (take the ceiling if the number is not an integer).
# If the number of instances is 1, take no action.
# 25% <= Average utilization <= 60%: Take no action.
# Average utilization > 60%: An action is instantiated to double the number of instances if the doubled value does not exceed 2* 10^8. If the number of instances exceeds this limit upon doubling,
# perform no action.
# Given an array of integers that represent the average utilization at each second, determine the number of instances at the end of the time frame.

# Example

# instances = 2
# averageUtil = [25, 23, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 76, 80]

# At second 1, the average utilization averageUtil[0] = 25 <= 25. Take no action.
# At second 2, the average utilization averageUtil[1] = 23 < 25. Reduce the number of instances by half, 2/2 = 1.
# Since an action was taken, the system will stop checking for 10 seconds, from averageUtil[2] to averageUtil[11].
# At averageUtil[12] = 76, 76 > 60 so the number of instances is doubled from 1 to 2.
# There are no more readings to consider and 2 is the final answer.
# Function Description

# Complete the function finallnstances in the editor below.

# finallnstances has the following parameter(s):
#    int instances: an integer that represents the original number of instances running
#    int averageUtil[n]: an array of integers that represents the average utilization at each second of the time frame

# Returns:
#    int: an integer that represents the final number of instances running.

# Contraints

# 1 <= instances <= 10^5
# 1 <= n < 10^5
# 0 <= averageUtil[i] <= 100
