**Difference between SQL and MySQL**

SQL = abstraction or a language; there is no implementation involved. Language used to interact with databases. MySQL = piece of software; database relational management tool. Implements those relational databases. 

**PRIMARY KEYS**

Primary key = Three main components: (1) It can't be duplicated, (2) Cannot be NULL/Blank, (3) Each table can only have one key. Therefore, it's a unique, non-nullible identifier for each record in a table (can be one column or multiple). 

**JOINS**
Way to 'join' two types of tables using logical commands; function allows us to use set of logic. There are four *main ones-- inner, outer, left and right (but in reality there are 7--> left, inner, right, full outer, cross, self, and natural). 


Example: 
List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'.

*Essentially just a JOIN and WHERE statement. 

```sql
SELECT go.player

FROM goal go JOIN game ga ON go.matchid = ga.id
WHERE ga.stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw';

```

_INNER JOIN_ : records with matches in both tables. 

Pros: 
- efficient for combining datasaets with only relevant matches.
- eliminates mismatched or NULL rows.

Cons:
- excludes data without matches, which might lead to loss of critical information.
  

Problem 1. Find engineers earning above the average salary. 

```SQL
SELECT e.id, e.name, s.salary

FROM employees e INNER JOIN salaries s ON e.id = s.employee_id

WHERE s.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM salaries) AND e.department = 'Engineering';

```

Problem 2. How would you identify missing rows in an INNER JOIN result? 

Use LEFT JOIN and filter with WHERE right_table.column is NULL.
