Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL. 

A. Introduction
The common table expression (CTE) is a powerful construct in SQL that helps simplify a query. CTEs
work as virtual tables (with records and columns), created during the execution of a query, 
used by the query, and eliminated after query execution. CTEs often act as a bridge to transform the data in source tables to the fortmat expected by the query. 

A common table expression, or CTE, is a temporary named result set created from a simple SELECT statement that can be used in a subsequent SELECT statement. Each SQL CTE is like a named query, whose result is stored in a virtual table (a CTE) to be referenced later in the main query.
