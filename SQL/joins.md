**SQL JOIN**

A `JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. For instance in this "Orders" table:

|OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate | 
| :---         |     :---     |:--- |
| 10308 | 2    | 1996-09-18    | 
|  10309     | 37       | 1996-09-19      | 
| 10310 | 77 | 1996-09-20 |
