We printed the two lines of output:
1. We printed the literal string ```Hello, World!``` using the code provided in the editor.
2. The value of parameterVariable passed to our main function in this Sample Case was ```Welcome to 10 Days of JavaScript!```. We then passed our variable to console.log, which printed the contents of parameterVariable.
